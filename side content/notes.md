#Side quest ideas for chapter 1

Silly/Serious?

Idea to include a side quest that involves the same NPC with increasing issues in each chapter.

Ch1 – “Hey, I’m missing my family’s pendant.”
Ch2 – “Hey, I’m missing my horse.”
Ch3 – “Hey, somebody stole my house’s front door!”
Ch4 – “Hey, somebody… somebody stole my house. The whole thing.”

Trading quest – Finding a key NPC that will trade up a series of special items.

NPC 1 – “Oh, you have a Stuffed Bear? Can I trade it for a Pink Pangolin Stuffy?

NPC 2 – “Hey, that’s a Pink Pangolin! Can I trade you this Fishing Rod that my dad used to own?”

NPC 3
